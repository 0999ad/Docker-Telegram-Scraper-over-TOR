- **Interactive Web Dashboard**: Utilizes Flask to present scraping results dynamically, with real-time updates and insights.
- **Efficient Parallel Processing**: Employs concurrent scraping to expedite data collection from multiple channels simultaneously.
- **User-Friendly Customization**: Designed for easy adaptability to specific requirements, supporting straightforward modifications and extensions.
